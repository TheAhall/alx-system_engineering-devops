Explanation:

   -DNS Resolution: The browser sends a DNS request to the DNS server to resolve the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.

   -Resolver: The resolver on the client machine receives the IP address from the DNS server.

   -Load Balancer: The client's request is directed to the appropriate server by a load balancer, ensuring even distribution of traffic.

   -Firewall: The traffic passes through a firewall, which filters and monitors incoming and outgoing traffic to enforce security policies.

   -HTTPS/SSL Encryption: The communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS/SSL, ensuring secure data transmission.

   -Web Server: The request reaches the web server, which serves the requested web page to the client.

   -Application Server: The web server interacts with the application server, which generates the web page dynamically and retrieves data from the database.

   -Database: The application server communicates with the database to fetch or store data required for generating the web page.
